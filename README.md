# 🌍 EcoSwap: Community-Driven Circular Marketplace

**EcoSwap** is a full-stack Django application designed to reduce waste by facilitating a direct "Give-and-Take" economy. The platform enables users to list underutilized assets and connect with others for local swaps, directly supporting environmental sustainability goals.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Django 5.x (Python 3.11)
* **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* **Database**: MySQL
* **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
